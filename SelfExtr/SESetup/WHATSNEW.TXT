WinZip(R) Self-Extractor 2.1

Changes in version 2.1:

 * All 32-bit self-extracting Zip files support Microsoft(R)
   Authenticode(tm) technology.  In earlier versions, the
   self-extracting Zip file's integrity check conflicted with
   Authenticode.  (For information on Authenticode, visit the Microsoft
   home page, click the "Search" button and search for "authenticode
   code signing".)

 * User-specified icons:  you can use an icon of your choice for all
   types of self-extractors except "Compact" and "MS-DOS + Windows".
   These icons are displayed in the Explorer (in version 2.0,
   user-specified icons were only used in the dialog box of
   self-extractors for software installation).

 * While version 2.0 made it possible to build 32-bit self-extracting
   Zip files, the program that created these 32-bit files was actually a
   16-bit program.  A 32-bit version (wzipse32.exe) is now included.

 * You can now create self-extracting Zip files that unzip
   automatically.  (In version 2.0 the end-user had to specify /auto on
   the command line while running the self-extracting file to unzip
   automatically.)  Use this new feature with caution:  if you are
   planning to post this file on the Internet or an online service like
   CompuServe or AOL, you should be aware that some sysops refuse to
   accept files that unzip without a prompt.

 * The "Mail Self-Extracting Zip File:  button in the final wizard panel
   makes it easy to send a self-extractor to another user by e-mail
   (this feature is available only if your system supports MAPI, the
   standard Mail Application Program Interface).

 * Password support for all types of self-extractors except "Compact"
   and "MS-DOS + Windows".

Changes in version 2.0:

WinZip Self-Extractor 2.0 is a superset of version 1.0.  Everything that
worked with version 1.0 works the same way with 2.0, but new features
are available, including:

 * Options to create self-extracting ZIP files with new headers:
   * 32-bit Win32 headers
   * 16-bit Windows headers with Windows 95 long filename support
   * MS-DOS support (one EXE works on either MS-DOS or Windows)

 * Improved automation and customization for software installation,
   such as the ability to specify an icon and text for the main dialog
   box, and to delete temporary files after running a setup program.
   Includes support for Sterling Software's InstallShield SETUP program.

 * All versions can be created with English or German messages.

 * Ability to automatically extract files when EXE file is run.

 * An optional progress meter while unzipping.

 * An uninstall facility for the WinZip Self-Extractor package.

 * Command lines options can be included in a file using the @filename
   syntax, e.g. "winzipse <some options> @"continued_options.inp".

 * A Wizard to simplify the process of building self-extracting files.
