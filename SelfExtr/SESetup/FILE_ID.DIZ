WinZip Self-Extractor 2.1 <ASP> SFX ZIP
Do you need to send files to end users who
may not have an unzip utility?  WinZip
Self-Extractor, an optional add-on for
WinZip, creates native Windows SFX files that
are as little as 12kb larger than the original
ZIP.  Version 2.0 creates 16-bit or 32-bit
Windows self-extractors, Windows+MS-DOS SFX
files, and includes a Wizard to simplify the
process of building self-extracting files.
