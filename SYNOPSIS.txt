BnB Modernization Project - Synopsis
=====================================

I've created two files for you:

1. CLAUDE.md
-----------
A guide for future Claude Code instances working with this repository. It documents:
- Technology stack (VB5, Access/DAO, Crystal Reports, Sheridan controls)
- Directory structure
- Build instructions
- Core module architecture (BNB1.BAS, BNBMODE.BAS)
- The form mode system (Browse/Insert/Update/Delete/Find)
- Data access patterns
- Modernization challenges

2. MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md
------------------------
A comprehensive plan for upgrading to Windows 10/11. Key highlights:

Recommended Approach: C# with .NET 8 WinForms
- Closest to original UX
- Fastest development path
- Direct database migration via Entity Framework Core

Migration Phases:
1. Foundation - New solution structure, database migration (Access -> SQL Server LocalDB or SQLite)
2. Core Modules - Convert BNB1.BAS utilities to services, implement FormStateManager
3. Form Migration - 45 forms prioritized by criticality (Guest, Accommodations, Payment first)
4. Reports - 27 Crystal Reports -> RDLC or modern alternative
5. Data Migration - One-time tool to move existing Access data
6. Testing & Deployment - MSI installer with migration wizard

Key Replacements:
-----------------
Old                     New
---                     ---
Crystal Reports         RDLC Reports
Sheridan SSDBGrid       DataGridView
DAO 2.5                 Entity Framework Core
Graphs32                LiveCharts2
WinHelp (.HLP)          HTML Help (.CHM)

The estimated effort is roughly 20,000-25,000 lines of C# code
to replace the ~25,000 lines of VB5 code.
